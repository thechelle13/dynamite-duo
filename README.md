# Power to the Developer

The developer tools of the browser are where you, as a developer, examine the evidence of what is happening in the main browser window where the HTML is rendered. It is where you will spend most of your time when diagnosing problems, working with CSS, and debugging your code.

> Your DevTools should be open **all the time** while working on a project.

## Getting Started

### Create a Directory

In your terminal, create a new directory for your project. Navigate to the desired location and run:

```sh
mkdir dynamite-duo
cd dynamite-duo

Clone this repository into your newly created directory. Replace <project ssh link> with the actual SSH link for your project:
git clone <project ssh link>

Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code using the following command:
code .

Start the Web Server
In the terminal, type the following command to start the server: 
serve
This starts a simple web server that will load the contents of your index.html file into the browser.

In the terminal output, you will see a Local: URL. Open this URL in your browser, or click on the link provided, to view your project:
localhost:3000


By following these steps, you'll have your project set up and ready to be viewed in the browser.
